<p><b>Mason Gagnon</b>, <i>2/2/2024</i></p>
<p><strong>Scarface</strong> is my favorite movie of all time, and I serioulsy doubt it will ever be overtaken. The whole movie is entertaining and gripping from start to finish, and keeps you on edge with action, high drama, family and romance drama, beautiful visuals and an outstanding soundtrack, with suprising but welcome plot twists along the way.</p>
<p> The acting is top tier across the board, from everyone involved, the writing and dialouge is amazing, countless memorable lines and scenes, and a grandiose ending to an amazing character arc.</p>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<ul>
<li>While the movie was released by Universal studios on December 9th, many theaters didnt show it until December 25th, leading some to claim Scarface as a Christmas movie.</li>
<li>The scene in which Tony steals Elviras hat in the Cadillac was unscripted and improved by Al Pacino, to which Michelle Pfieffer ad libbed her line in response.</li>
<li>The original cut shown to the MPAA was rated X, and remained rated X until the third cut of the film, in which narcotics detectives told the MPAA board the film was anti-drug and should be seen as is. However after the third cut passed as R, Brian DePalma released the original cut of the film anyway, expecting studio executives to not tell the difference.</li>
